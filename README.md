## Hi there 👋
# My name is Todd Conner

**QA Engineer | Cloud & CI Enthusiast | Former RF Engineering Manager**

I’m a quality-driven technologist with a background in **wireless/RF engineering leadership** and a current focus on **software QA, cloud platforms, and CI pipelines**.  
I build things end-to-end, test them like a skeptic, and document them like a professional.

Think **season-long stat sheet**, not highlight reel.

## 🔍 What I Do
- 🧪 Design and execute **manual + automated UI and API tests**
- ⚙️ Build **Playwright test suites** with evidence-first reporting
- 🔁 Implement **CI (Continuous Integration)** pipelines using GitHub Actions  
- ☁️ Work across **AWS, Azure, and GCP**
- 🧠 Translate complex systems into **clear, testable requirements**

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Testing**
- Playwright (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Manual QA, exploratory testing
- API testing (Postman)
- Test case design & defect reporting

**CI / Dev**
- GitHub Actions (CI = *Continuous Integration*, originated in Agile/XP practices)
- Git, GitHub
- Node.js, TypeScript

**Cloud**
- AWS (EC2, IAM, Lightsail)
- Azure (App Services)
- GCP (IAM, projects, service accounts)

## 🧠 How I Think About Quality
- Evidence > opinions
- Failures should be **debuggable, not silent**
- Tests are documentation
- CI is a **gate**, not a checkbox

---

## 🏈 Background
Before software QA, I spent **20+ years in wireless/RF engineering**, leading teams responsible for network performance, optimization, and customer-impacting issue resolution.

That mindset still drives how I test:
- Root cause over symptoms
- Reproducibility matters
- Customers feel bugs before dashboards do
